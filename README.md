Introduction
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting the onset of diabetes based on various medical and lifestyle factors. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can help identify individuals at risk of developing diabetes ultimately supporting early intervention and improved health outcomes.
Files
Code File
Code_file.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the Python code for the machine learning model including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
Machine Learning Models
The ML explores several models for predicting diabetes onset including:
1.	Logistic Regression: A classic algorithm for binary classification tasks, used to predict whether an individual is likely to develop diabetes or not.
2.	Decision Trees: A tree-based model that learns to make decisions based on the input features and their importance in predicting the target variable (diabetes).
3.	Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve the model's accuracy and robustness.
4.	K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple algorithm that classifies data points based on the majority label of their closest neighbors.
5.	Support Vector Machines (SVM): A powerful algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate the data into two classes (diabetic or non-diabetic).
6.	Artificial Neural Networks: A deep learning model with multiple hidden layers, designed to learn complex patterns in the data and make accurate predictions.
The performance of these models is evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the most effective approach for predicting diabetes onset.
PKL Files
Model_pkl: A serialized machine learning model saved in the PKL format for easy deployment and reuse.
Scaler_pkl: A serialized data scaler object, used for preprocessing the input data.
Report
Report_file.docx: A detailed report documenting the project, including the problem statement, data analysis, model development, and findings.
Tableau File
Tableau_file.twb: A Tableau workbook containing interactive visualizations and dashboards for the project's data and results.
Tableau Visualizations
The Tableau workbook includes the following interactive visualizations:
1.	Diabetes Prevalence by Age and Gender: A bar chart showing the distribution of diabetes cases across different age groups and genders.
2.	Risk Factors Heatmap: A heatmap depicting the correlation between various risk factors (e.g., BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels) and the likelihood of developing diabetes.
3.	Clustering Analysis: A scatter plot with k-means clustering to identify patterns and subgroups within the diabetes dataset.
4.	Prediction Accuracy Dashboard: A dashboard showcasing the performance of the machine learning models, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
These visualizations help to explore the data, identify key relationships and communicate the project's findings.
Dataset
diabetes_data.csv: The dataset used for this project contains medical and lifestyle information for a sample of individuals.
